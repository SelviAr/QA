When do we do Regression Testing?
* Defect Fixes
* Performance or Security Issue Fixes on Code
* New Features Added 
* Optimization of Existing Features 
* Any changes in Integration Systems (Example: Payment Gateway System Software Upgraded from Version 1.0 to 2.0)
* Server Related Updates (Example: Movement of Application from Hosted Server Systems to Google Cloud)
* Software Version Updates (Example: Java Updates or JS Updates)

What to Perform as Regression Testing?
* Testing the Recent Code Changes  -- R
* Testing the Core functionalities of the Application  -- C
* Testing the Customer Specific Features (Example: Which are developed specifically for a customer on top of core functionalities)  -- C
* Testing the Configuration Related Features (Example: Verifying the Application is enabled with Email Configurations)  -- C
* Testing the frequent issues which were encountered after every deployment or release  --- F
* Testing the Integration Features (Example: API Integration with ERP System - Order Placement, Payment Gateway Integration - Credit Card Order Placement)  --- I
